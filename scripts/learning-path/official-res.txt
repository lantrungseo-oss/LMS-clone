But adding some of these types of capabilities requires a stronger programming language than HTML5 or CSS3, and JavaScript can provide just what you need.  With just a basic understanding of the language, you can create a page that will react to common events such as page loads, mouse clicks & movements, and even keyboard input.        This course will introduce you to the basics of the JavaScript language.  We will cover concepts such as variables, looping, functions, and even a little bit about debugging tools.  You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify and modify specific parts of your page.  After the course, learners will be able to react to DOM Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page.   The class will culminate in a  final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5 form that accepts and verifies input.  This is the third course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.  A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is expected when you enroll in this class.

As such, you will obtain solid foundations either for building your own tech business, or for joining one.  Deciding to create or to join a tech business in these early years is an out-of-the-ordinary adventure, and it certainly won�t be straightforward: you need to be ready to accept that not all "good" ideas will lead to success, and that only a very small number of projects lead to great success. You must learn to overhaul your relationship with failure, which is a valuable source of experience and should be managed according to the logic of �acceptable loss�: the entrepreneur loves uncertainty, not excessive risk. The creation of tech businesses gives you a genuine opportunity to change the world, but requires you to adopt a particular state of mind and to be able to acquire knowledge, know-how and interpersonal skills.  You will have the chance to work alongside passionate and exciting people from a whole multitude of backgrounds. From a technological point of view, these women and men have constructed numerous companies of a global scale.  The development trajectory of a tech business is full of mishaps which require you to be both agile and greatly prepared to build on a strong idea, choose your market, develop your proposal, assemble a team worthy of the task in hand, and finding financing.  The course is made up of methodological sessions as well as first-hand accounts from entrepreneurs and people who have succeeded in creating tech businesses themselves. You will thus be able to get to know the essential dilemmas with which high-tech business creators are confronted with, beginning with the initial decision to set up your very own structure, which itself represents a significant life decision.  You will also see that the creation of a tech business is much more a collective adventure than an individual one.

The goal is to design artifacts that allow the users to meet their needs in the most effective efficient and satisfying manner. The course introduces the novice to a cycle of discovery and evaluation and a set of techniques that meet the user's needs.  This course is geared toward the novice. It is for learners that have heard about "user experience" or "user interface" design but don't really know much about these disciplines.  The course mantra is that �Design is a systematic and data driven process.� Design is systematic because it is based on a set of techniques and also on a cycle of discovery.  In this course the learner is introduced to the four step user interface design cycle. Along the way learners are exposed to a set of techniques to gather information about a) what the user needs b)how to design and model interfaces based on these and then how to evaluate the design to ascertain that the user's goals are met. These techniques are tools that are used in a standardized manner and give us the data we use in our design.  This means that anyone (regardless of their current training) that is willing to learn these techniques and follow the proposed cycle can be a UX designer!<br/>Skills: user interface  experience design  User Research  evaluation  usability  User Experience  User Experience Design  experience  paper prototyping  user interface design computer-science design-and-product<br/>Difficulty Level: Beginner`

We will also demonstrate how the costs of bad design can often be severe (in user experience, money, and even human lives).  You will then gain a high-level understanding of the user-interface design process. You will be introduced to common design scenarios - e.g. improving on existing designs and starting a new design from scratch - and the general design processes that tend to be used for each scenario.

Building on the design skills learned in Visual Elements of User Interface Design, you will apply this methodology to produce a digital prototype for a multi-screen app of your own invention.  By the end of this course, you will be able to describe and apply current best practices and conventions in UX design, and employ the fundamental principles of how UX design functions to shape an audience's experience of a given body of content. This is the second course in the UI/UX Design Specialization, which brings a design-centric approach to user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone.  These courses are ideal for anyone with some experience in graphic or visual design and who would like to build their skill set in UI or UX for app and web design. It would also be ideal for anyone with experience in front- or back-end web development or human-computer interaction and want to sharpen their visual design and analysis skills for UI or UX.<br/>Skills: Map  User Experience  user interface  experience design  site map  experience  paper prototyping  User Experience Design  java annotation  website wireframe arts-and-humanities music-and-art<br/>Difficulty Level: Beginner"

      title: 'Foundations of marketing analytics',
      description: "Who is this course for?   This course is designed for students, business analysts, and data scientists who want to apply statistical knowledge and techniques to business contexts. For example, it may be suited to experienced statisticians, analysts, engineers who want to move more into a business role, in particular in marketing.  You will find this course exciting and rewarding if you already have a background in statistics, can use R or another programming language and are familiar with databases and data analysis techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering. However, it contains a number of recitals and R Studio tutorials which will consolidate your competences, enable you to play more freely with data and explore new features and statistical functions in R.  Business Analytics, Big Data and Data Science are very hot topics today, and for good reasons. Companies are sitting on a treasure trove of data, but usually lack the skills and people to analyze and exploit that data efficiently. Those companies who develop the skills and hire the right people to analyze and exploit that data will have a clear competitive advantage.  It's especially true in one domain: marketing. About 90% of the data collected by companies today are related to customer actions and marketing activities.The domain of Marketing Analytics is absolutely huge, and may cover fancy topics such as text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, real-time bidding, online campaign optimization, and so on.  But at the heart of marketing lie a few basic questions that often remain unanswered: (1) who are my customers, (2) which customers should I target and spend most of my marketing budget on, and (3) what's the future value of my customers so I can concentrate on those who will be worth the most to the company in the future.  That's exactly what this course will cover: segmentation is all about understanding your customers, scorings models are about targeting the right ones, and customer lifetime value is about anticipating their future value. These are the foundations of Marketing Analytics. And that's what you'll learn to do in this course.<br/>Skills: predictive analytics  analytics  market (economics)  Stochastic Matrix  Market Analysis  customer lifetime value  Marketing  market segmentation  Data Analysis  analysis business marketing<br/>Difficulty Level: Intermediate"

      title: 'Creating and Developing a Tech Startup',
      description: 'This course will allow you to identify and evaluate opportunities for creating a tech business, and to better understand its principal issues on a�human, technical, commercial, environmental and financial level.  As such, you will obtain solid foundations either for building your own tech business, or for joining one.  Deciding to create or to join a tech business in these early years is an out-of-the-ordinary adventure, and it certainly won�t be straightforward: you need to be ready to accept that not all "good" ideas will lead to success, and that only a very small number of projects lead to great success. You must learn to overhaul your relationship with failure, which is a valuable source of experience and should be managed according to the logic of �acceptable loss�: the entrepreneur loves uncertainty, not excessive risk. The creation of tech businesses gives you a genuine opportunity to change the world, but requires you to adopt a particular state of mind and to be able to acquire knowledge, know-how and interpersonal skills.  You will have the chance to work alongside passionate and exciting people from a whole multitude of backgrounds. From a technological point of view, these women and men have constructed numerous companies of a global scale.  The development trajectory of a tech business is full of mishaps which require you to be both agile and greatly prepared to build on a strong idea, choose your market, develop your proposal, assemble a team worthy of the task in hand, and finding financing.  The course is made up of methodological sessions as well as first-hand accounts from entrepreneurs and people who have succeeded in creating tech businesses themselves. You will thus be able to get to know the essential dilemmas with which high-tech business creators are confronted with, beginning with the initial decision to set up your very own structure, which itself represents a significant life decision.  You will also see that the creation of a tech business is much more a collective adventure than an individual one.  In the English version, all of the reading content, quizzes and assesments will be in English, whilst the videos will have French audio and English subtitles.<br/>Skills: Strategy  enabling  market (economics)  experience  business plan  leadership  Innovation  organizing (management)  intellectual property  project business entrepreneurship<br/>Difficulty Level: Advanced'

      title: 'Exploring Emerging Technologies for Lifelong Learning and Success',
      description: 'This learning opportunity is an open-access resource for lifelong learning. The aim is to identify the value and implications of using established and emerging technology tools for personal and professional growth and acquire strategies to develop lifelong learning habits to keep pace with technology change.  This course is targeted to the needs of ALL learners, including college students, faculty, current and career-seeking professionals, and anyone from across the globe with a desire to learn how to use emerging technologies to succeed in today�s rapidly changing world.  This project consists of two associated parts; #EmTechMOOC and EmTechWIKI.  #EmTechMOOC is a Massive Open Online Course, also called a MOOC. The MOOC is hosted on the Coursera platform and provides a supportive environment for dialogue and sharing among participants.  EmTechWIKI ( http://suny.edu/emtech ) has been built to complement the MOOC. It is a socially-curated discovery engine to discover tools, tutorials, and resources. The WIKI can be used as a stand-alone resource, or it can be used together with #EmTechMOOC. Anyone is welcome to add or edit WIKI resources.  The MOOC learning environment is structured around 5 modules. The concepts that are covered include Lifelong Learning and the 4Cs of 21st-century skills: including Communication and Collaboration, Creativity, Critical Thinking. Participants build a personal ePortfolio to display artifacts created through Discovery Exercises to showcase accomplishments. The final module provides an opportunity to summarize and reflect on the learning journey.  Learning activities provide accessible, curated information and application exercises pertaining to current and emerging technologies relevant to learners and professionals alike, such as audio, video, social networking, etc.  #EmTechMOOC is not a traditional MOOC. Instead of providing content-heavy information, it relies on discovery-based learning that is under the control of the learner. You will be prompted to locate and explore new resources and tools from the growing EmTechWIKI collection to help you meet your personally identified objectives. You will then reflect on and share your learning and discoveries through your personal portfolio that you will construct throughout the modules in the course.  Complete the MOOC requirements to earn digital badges and a Coursera Certificate of Completion. SUNY affiliates may earn a Coursera Certificate with no fees to enroll.<br/>Skills: Social Media  emerging technologies  Human Learning  professional networks  Social Media Tools  Creativity  lifelong learning  Critical Thinking  Communication  digital footprint personal-development personal-development<br/>Difficulty Level: Beginner'

      title: "Competitive Programmer's Core Skills",
      description: 'During the course, you�ll learn everything needed to participate in real competitions � that�s the main goal. Along the way you�ll also gain useful skills for which competitive programmers are so highly valued by employers: ability to write efficient, reliable, and compact code, manage your time well when it�s limited, apply basic algorithmic ideas to real problems, etc.  We start from the very beginning by teaching you what competitions there are, what are their rules, what specifics problems have, how to read problem statements, how to organize your work, and what you should and shouldn�t do. So it�s fine if you�ve never taken part in programming competitions before.  We�ll focus on skills essential to competitive programming: inventing solutions and proving their correctness, estimating their running time, testing and debugging programs, how to benefit from structuring code. We�ll also cover basic algorithmic ideas: brute force search, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, segment trees.  On competitions, there are a lot of specific pitfalls, perilous to beginners � but that�s not to worry, as we�ll go through the most common of them: integer overflow and issues with fractional numbers, troubles of particular programming languages, how to get unstuck in general.  And, you�ll hone all these skills by solving practice problems, which are just like problems on real competitions. You could use any of the following programming languages: C, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python 2, Python 3, Ruby, Rust, Scala. We assume that you already know how to write simplest programs in one of these.<br/>Skills: greedy algorithm  integer overflow  matrix chain multiplication  Algorithms  computer program  Computer Programming  edit distance  competitiveness  dynamic programming  segment tree computer-science algorithms<br/>Difficulty Level: Intermediate'
